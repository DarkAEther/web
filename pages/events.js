                        Roadshow is an Innovation Expo organized by the Lab each year after the Summer Internship Program.
                        PES Lab summer interns present the projects that they have worked on during the internship.
                        This serves as a great platform for students from PES University to interact with members and
                        gain knowledge about the cutting-edge technologies that we work on. Roadshow also serves as a platform
                        where our interns receive constructive feedback and further insights on their projects from experienced professionals,
                        professors and their peers.
